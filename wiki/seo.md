# SEO Strategy 2024-2025

## Executive Summary

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, establishing a strong SEO presence requires more than just following traditional optimization practices. This strategy document outlines our approach to dominating the Swiss web development market, with a particular focus on the Romandie region.

Our strategy leverages two key insights about the current state of SEO:
1. Google's increasing emphasis on authentic expertise and first-hand experience
2. The growing importance of local market understanding and presence

To capitalize on these trends, we're implementing a dual-content approach that separates our authority-building content from our broader market reach efforts. This allows us to maintain high E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) standards while maximizing our visibility across different search intents.
